**Stop paying twice for AI.** VibeProxy is a native Windows application that lets you use your existing Claude Code, ChatGPT, **Gemini**, and **Qwen** subscriptions with powerful AI coding tools like **[Factory Droids](https://app.factory.ai/r/FM8BJHFQ)** – no separate API keys required.

Built on [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI), it handles OAuth authentication, token management, and API routing automatically. One click to authenticate, zero friction to code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NEW: Gemini and Qwen Support! 🎉** VibeProxy now supports Google's Gemini AI and Qwen AI with full OAuth authentication. Connect your accounts and use Gemini and Qwen with your favorite AI coding tools!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NEW: Extended Thinking Support! 🧠** VibeProxy now supports Claude's extended thinking feature with dynamic budgets (4K, 10K, 32K tokens). Use model names like `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-thinking-10000` to enable extended thinking. See the [Factory Setup Guide](FACTORY_SETUP.md#step-3-configure-factory-cli) for details.
